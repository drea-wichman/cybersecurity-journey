# My Cybersecurity Journey


## About Me
I'm starting my cybersecurity journey from whatever comes before square one...no prior tech experience, just a lot of curiosity about how it all works. I'll be documenting everything I learn here as I work toward landing my first role in the field.

## Current Status
- Studying for CompTIA A+ Core 1
- Learning security fundamentals

## Current Projects
- Personal OpSec Setup: custom domain email with Proton, DKIM/SPF/DMARC, & unique aliases per service
- Nitrokey hardware security key setup
- [Home Lab](https://github.com/drea-wichman/IT-homelab) - Active Directory and virtualization practice

## Goals
- Pass CompTIA A+ (shooting to complete Core 1+2 by March 2026)
- Build a home lab environment
- Set up Active Directory
- Complete TryHackMe paths
- Land entry-level cybersecurity role
