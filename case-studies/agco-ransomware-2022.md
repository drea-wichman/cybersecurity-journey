# AGCO Ransomware Attack (2022)
**Type:** GRC Case Study | NIST CSF Analysis  
**Date:** March 13, 2026  

---

## Overview
AGCO Corporation is a global agricultural machinery and parts manufacturer founded in 1990 and headquartered in Duluth, Georgia. Operating across North America, Europe, and Asia under brands including Massey Ferguson, Fendt, and Challenger, AGCO serves farmers and dealers worldwide.
On May 5, 2022, AGCO discovered a ransomware attack through its Massey Ferguson sector with initial entry points identified in facilities across France, Germany, and China. The attack rapidly disrupted operations globally. The day prior, the AGCO Foundation had donated $50,000 to the BORSCH initiative supporting Ukrainian farming communities affected by the Russia-Ukraine war. Two weeks before the attack, the FBI had issued a warning that ransomware groups were targeting the US agricultural sector, with attacks potentially timed to critical seasons.
The attack occurred during spring planting season, one of two narrow windows in the agricultural calendar where farmers plant crops. Disruption during this window has irreversible consequences as unplanted fields cannot be planted later in the season. This directly impacts harvest yields, farm income, and food supply chains.

## Timeline
- **September 2021** — FBI issues first warning about ransomware targeting agricultural companies during harvest season. Six grain companies attacked between September 15 and October 6, 2021.
- **April 20, 2022** — FBI issues warning that ransomware groups are targeting the US agricultural companies with attacks potentially timed to critical seasons.
- **May 4, 2022** — AGCO Foundation donates $50,000 to the BORSCH Initiative supporting Ukrainian farming communities affected by the Russia-Ukraine war.
- **May 5, 2022** — AGCO discovers ransomware attack through its Massey Ferguson sector. Facilities in France, Germany and China affected. Over 1,000 employees sent home from French production facilities.
- **May 6, 2022** — AGCO publicly discloses the attack. Stock drops 5.76%. Company states operations expected to be affected for "several days and potentially longer."
- **May 16, 2022** — AGCO reports majority of production sites have resumed operations. Confirms data exfiltration occurred, including employee data but no customer data.
- **May 25, 2022** — Black Basta ransomware group claims responsibility on their site and publishes sample of AGCO's exfiltrated employee data.
  
## Threat Actor
**Group:** Black Basta  
**Type:** RaaS  
**Origin:** Suspected Russia-linked  
**Method:** Ransomware (double extortion) — encrypted AGCO systems and exfiltrated data, threatening to publish if ransom unpaid  
**Claimed Responsibility:** Yes — posted sample of exfiltrated employee data on leak site May 25, 2022, corroborated by AGCO 
confirming data exfiltration  
**Notable:** Group emerged April 2022 and quickly became one of the most active ransomware groups in the world hitting hundreds of organizations globally. Suspected ties to the now inactive Conti ransomware group. At time of attack no known decryption tool existed so victims could only recover data via backups or ransom payment.

## Operational Impact
When AGCO's systems were encrypted, the disruption spread across every layer of the organization simultaneously. Corporate and admin communications, factory floor manufacturing software, dealer ordering portals, and customer facing websites all went offline. Over 1,000 employees were sent home from production facilities in France alone. Facilities in Germany, China, and others were similarly affected. Backlogs were already significant (typical for planting season) when AGCO's 1000+ North American dealerships lost the ability to place orders.
The timing of the attack compounded the damage. Planting season is one of two narrow windows in the agricultural calendar where farmers must act. Unlike most industries where lost production time can be recovered, nature does not offer a second chance. Fields not planted in May cannot be planted in July. The consequences are permanent for that season: no crop in the ground in spring means no harvest in the fall, no farm revenue, and of course no product available for sale or consumption.
Farmers who needed brand new equipment or replacement parts for already acquired equipment during this window had no way to get them and no service support. Seedsuppliers faced reduced demand as farmers had no reason to buy seed with no equipment. Downstream, food processors, traders, and consumers were affected by this supply chain disruption.
AGCO absorbed immediate stock losses of 5.76% on the day of disclosure and committed to increase production for the remainder of 2022 to make up what was lost. The company arranged identity protection services for all employees whose personal data was stolen. An investor investigation was launched by a law firm shortly after. AGCO's Q1 2022 net sales up to the attack had been approximately $2.7 billion. At that revenue scale, every day of production downtime is a significant financial loss.

## Control Failures & Risk Gaps
**Failure to act on threat intelligence:** The FBI issued warnings about ransomware explicitly targeting the agricultural industry first in September 2021 and again on April 20, 2022 (fifteen days before the attack). Despite the warnings that were relevant to AGCO, the organization was still successfully compromised. This suggests a critical gap between threat awareness and threat response. Whether the warnings failed to reach decision makers, lacked urgency, or were deprioritized, the result reflects a governance failure.

**Insufficient network segmentation:** The ransomware spread rapidly across facilities in France, Germany, China, and beyond, disrupting global operations within hours. Network segmentation would have contained the malware by isolating departments, levels, and regional networks from one another. The speed and scope of the spread strongly suggests these boundaries either did not exist or were poorly enforced.

**Inadequate detection and response:** Black Basta had already stolen data and encrypted systems before AGCO even knew they were being attacked. This suggests AGCO had no tools or processes in place to detect an intruder entering their network.

**Backup and recovery gaps:** Black Basta's ransomware could not be decrypted because there was no tool available at the time to unlock the encrypted files. That left AGCO with only two options: pay the ransom or restore from backups. The fact that recovery took nearly two weeks suggests their backups were either incomplete, untested, or not properly isolated from the network that was compromised. The FBI's April 2022 warning had specfiically recommended offline backups as a basic defense.

## Regulatory & Compliance Implications
**SEC Disclosure:** As a publicly traded company, AGCO was required to disclose the attack to investors. They did so the following day which was fast. In 2022 SEC rules around cybersecurity disclosure were still vague. This changed in 2023 when the SEC formally required companies to disclose incidents within four business days.

**GDPR:** Because the attack entered through AGCO's facilities in France and Germany, GDPR was immediately triggered which requires organizations to notify data protection authorities within 72 hours of discovering a breach. Since employee info was exfiltrated from EU facilities, AGCO was also required to notify affected employees.

**Dual Jurisdiction:** The same attack created different legal obligations depending on geography. While European operations triggered GDPR's 72 hour rule, the US had no equivalent federal requirement in 2022. EU employees had stronger legal protections than US employees from the exact same incident.

**OFAC Sanctions Risk:** Whether AGCO paid the ransom was never disclosed. However, paying ransom to a sanctioned entity is a potential federal violation under OFAC rules. Black Basta has suspected Russian ties and Russia has sanctioned entities on the OFAC list. This put AGCO in a difficult position: pay and risk a sanctions violation, or don't pay and extend the disruption.

**US Regulatory Gap:** No US federal law required AGCO to disclose whether they paid a ransom which makes it impossible to track ransom payments, enforce sanctions compliance, or discourage future payments. A law called CIRCIA was passed in 2022 to address this but it only applies to "critical infrastructure" industries like energy and healthcare. Agriculture is not consistently included in that category which leaves ag companies in a regulatory blind spot.

## NIST CSF Mapping
**Identify — Fail**  
AGCO had two FBI warnings telling them exactly what was coming. A proper risk management process would have taken those seriously, (re)assessed their exposure, and done something about it. That didn't happen. Whether the warnings never reached the right people or were simply deprioritized, the result was the same.

**Protect — Fail**  
The ransomware spread across multiple countries almost instantly. That doesn't happen when proper network segmentation is in place. Different facilities, departments, and systems should be isolated from each other so that if one gets hit, the rest don't follow. AGCO's network clearly wasn't built that way. The FBI's April warning even spelled out exactly what to do: isolated backups, segmentation, MFA. None of it appears to have been implemented in time.  

**Detect — Fail**  
By the time AGCO knew they were being attacked, it was already over. Black Basta had been inside their systems long enough to both encrypt files and steal data before anyone noticed. That's a detection failure. Better monitoring would have caught unusual activity earlier and given AGCO a chance to stop it before the damage was done.  

**Respond — Pass**  
This is the one area AGCO handled reasonably well. Once they discovered the attack they moved fast: shutting systems down to stop the spread, going public the next day, notifying affected employees, and working with law enforcement and authorities across multiple countries. Not perfect, but organized.  

**Recover — Partial**  
Recovery took about two weeks which for most industries might be acceptable. During planting season it was devastating. The length of the recovery also raises questions about whether AGCO had proper backups in place — because a prepared company should not need two weeks to get back online.

## Recommendations
Based on the failures identified, the following measures could have reduced the likelihood and impact of this attack:  

**Act on threat intelligence:** When the FBI issues an industry-specific warning it should trigger an immediate internal review. Who received it, did it reach leadership, and what changed as a result? AGCO had two warnings and no visible response. Organizations need a formal process for receiving, escalating, and acting on threat intelligence, not just filing it away.  

**Implement network segmentation:** Manufacturing systems, corporate IT, and regional networks should be isolated from each other. If one segment gets hit, the rest stay up. This is architecture that could have contained the AGCO attack to a fraction of the damage it caused.  

**Invest in detection and monitoring:** You can't stop what you can't see. AGCO needed 24/7 monitoring capable of identifying unusual activity before ransomware fully deploys. Earlier detection equals more options.  

**Maintain tested, air-gapped backups:** Backups are only useful if they work when you need them. They need to be offline so ransomware can't reach them, and they need to be tested regularly so recovery is fast. The FBI literally recommended this in April 2022. It should have already been standard practice for a company of AGCO's size.  

**Develop a ransomware-specific incident response plan:**
AGCO's response was decent but reactive. A pre-built ransomware playbook including who gets called, what gets shut down, how to communicate with dealers, employees, regulators, and investors removes the guesswork during a crisis and speeds up every decision.  

**Understand your regulatory exposure:** A company operating across the US and EU needs to know exactly what its disclosure obligations are before an incident happens, not during one. GDPR's 72 hour clock starts the moment you're aware of a breach. That's not enough time to figure out the rules from scratch.

## Lessons Learned
- Threat intelligence is only useful if you use it.
The FBI warned the agricultural sector twice. AGCO got hit anyway. Receiving a warning and responding to a warning are two completely different things. Organizations need processes that turn intelligence into action not just awareness.
-  Timing is a weapon.
Black Basta didn't hit AGCO in January. They hit during planting season when the pressure to restore operations was highest and the willingness to pay was greatest. Attackers understand operational calendars. Organizations in seasonal industries need to treat their most critical windows as elevated threat periods with additional controls in place.
- Geography creates compliance complexity.
The same ransomware attack triggered completely different legal obligations depending on which country's systems were hit first. Organizations with global operations need to understand their regulatory situation across every jurisdiction they operate in, not just their home country.
- Double extortion changes the calculus.
Backups alone are no longer enough. Black Basta didn't just encrypt, they stole. Even if AGCO could restore everything from backups, the stolen employee data was already gone. Organizations need data loss prevention controls, not just recovery controls.
- The ransom decision is never simple.
Pay and risk a sanctions violation. Don't pay and face prolonged downtime and public data exposure. There is no clean option once ransomware is active. The only real answer is prevention.
